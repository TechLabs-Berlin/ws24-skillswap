## About Project

SkillSwap is an online platform that connects individuals with various skills and facilitates skill exchange. This app will allow users to create profiles, list their skills, and search for others who are willing to exchange skills. It will provide features such as messaging, scheduling, and rating systems to ensure smooth and organized exchanges. As skills are exchanged, this app  addresses the issue of costs associated with acquiring new skills.
