<h1 align="center">SkillSwap- A Platform for Skill Exchange • Blog Post</h1>

<br>

## Summary


SkillSwap is a simple yet powerful mobile application that facilitates user skill exchange. The core objective of our project is to create a platform where individuals can connect, share their expertise, and learn from one another.


## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced world, the exchange of skills has become more important than ever. However, many individuals face significant challenges when it comes to accessing and exchanging skills effectively. Traditional methods such as paid services or formal education often present barriers, limiting opportunities for many.

Through competitive research on existing skill exchange platforms, we were able to identify some challenges that we have hoped to address differently with SkillSwap. We narrowed down the primary challenges in the current landscape of skill exchange:

1. Limited Access to Diverse Skills: Despite the abundance of valuable skills in our communities, there is often no platform or place to easily connect individuals with others who can benefit from their expertise.

2. Unequal Exchange Opportunities: Traditional methods of skill exchange, such as apprenticeships or universities, can be costly and exclusive, leaving many individuals without access to valuable learning opportunities due to financial constraints or lack of formal qualifications.

3. Lack of Organization and Structure: Without a centralised platform, finding suitable skill exchange opportunities or coordinating exchanges efficiently can be a daunting task.

# Our Solution

As SkillSwap we therefore wanted to address these challenges and so we set out to develop a solution: a user-friendly platform that connects individuals with various skills and facilitates seamless skill exchange through a matching algorithm.

# Methodology


**User Experience Design (UX)**

The UX team played a crucial role in shaping the user experience of SkillSwap. We began by conducting extensive research to understand user needs and preferences. This involved brainstorming sessions to define key features and ‘How might we’ statements to address specific user pain points. After then developing personas and creating low-fidelity wireframes we were able to visualise the app’s flow and functionality. Finally, the Hi-Fi wireframes and prototype were created on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/P4FGekK8KHUDRuVefXLZb5/Wireframes?type=design&node-id=213%3A4346&mode=design&t=ep7tdIhxN8qQM1WO-1) and we conducted a usabilty test at the end.

Throughout the development process, the UX team collaborated closely with other teams to ensure alignment between design and implementation. Regular meetings were held to discuss design updates and to integrate any feedback that was given. As the project progressed, the team iterated on the wireframes and eventually created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma.

In addition to design work, the UX team also contributed to user testing and feedback collection. They conducted usability tests to identify any issues or areas for improvement and incorporated user feedback into the final design.

# Conclusion

What a thrilling journey. We worked hard, and well, together as a team. Many obstacles constrained the progress of the project at certain points but it was nothing that wasn’t able to be solved. As a group we had two mentors, Larry and Maria, who helped us with workshop ideas, and brainstorming sessions and were there around the clock for guidance and to answer our questions.
